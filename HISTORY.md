==================
* clearfix pr

v1.1.3
==================
* remove cleanOnDetached

v1.1.2
==================
* fixed issue with auto resize and take label length into account for determining size. The chart should now more precisely use the space available

v1.1.1
==================
* fixed bug where register doesnt mute on start with mutedAxes

v1.1.0
==================
* upgraded to vis 1.1.0
* progressive rendering now can be customized through progressiveRenderingPointsPerFrame (16000 by default for lines, 2000 byy default for scatter) and progressiveRenderingMinimumFrames. Increase progressiveRenderingPointsPerFrame for better performance and decrease for smoother drawing. When at the right value no performance cost incurs and drawing is smooth but if value is too small can incur a performance cost (i.e the drawing will take longer but will still start at the same time, also the UI won't be frozen)
* added cleanOnDetached to allow reuse of the chart after detaching it from the dom. This is aimed at applications creating charts dynamically so that they can keep a pool of charts (simple array of charts) when removing them from the dom and reusing them later on with new data and config, improving performance . Turning cleanOnDetached on will make sure the chart will clear everything needed so that it draws properly with any new config. If using this strategy one thing to keep in mind is making sure the chart is re-appended in the dom *before* changing its properties to their new values. In most cases it would work even if appending it after, but some edge cases scenarios might fail to clean some visual artifact (for example switching from canvas to svg while deleting a few series at the same time). When moving the chart around the dom do not turn it on for performance boost and making sure you don't need the chart to force redrawing. This can be changed dynamically
* added debounceResizeTiming to control the debounce timing on auto resize, changed default from 100ms to 250ms
